    <p>Have you always wanted to learn how to make boiled water? You've come to the right place, and you don't even have
        to read a dumb story about my family to get to it!</p>
    </p>
    <h2>Equipment and Ingredients Needed:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Pot, with or without lid</li>
        <li>Heat source, like a stovetop, hotplate, or campfire</li>
        <li>Water, preferably clean</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Get your heat source up and running. Make sure it's nice and hot.</li>
        <li>Add the water to the pot. If you have a lid, place it on the pot after you add the water, not before. If you
            don't have a lid, skip the step about adding the lid to the pot.</li>
        <li>Place your pot on your heat source.</li>
        <li>Wait patiently. If you are using a lid, avoid taking the lid off the pot. This makes the water take longer
            to boil. I don't know why.</li>
        <li>Eventually, small bubbles should start to form at the bottom of the pot as everything heats up. Don't panic-
            this is just the beginning stages of a boil.</li>
        <li>Keep waiting. If your heat source is hot enough, the pot should begin boiling more rapidly.</li>
        <li>That's pretty much it. Keep it boiling by maintaining the heat for as long as you want/are able, then use
            the boiling water for whatever you want.</li>
    </ol>
