        to make your room temperature water here!</p>
    <h2>Equipment and Ingredients Needed:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Water, preferably clean</li>
        <li>Some kind of container to hold the water</li>
        <li>A room that is at room temperature</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Take the water you would like to convert to room temperature and pour it into your vessel of choice.</li>
        <li>Transport the water from your current location to a room that is a room temperature, approximately 69-77
            degrees F.</li>
        <li>Allow the water in the container to sit in the room temperature room for about an hour. Check on its
            progress by feeling the outside of the container or carefully dipping your hand into the water. If it feels
            like it's at about room temperature, you are now able to use it for your desired purpose. If it's not quite
            where you want it, allow the water to sit for a few more hours and check it again.</li>
    </ol>
